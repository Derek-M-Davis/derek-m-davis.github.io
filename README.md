General Assembly Project 1: Movie Details

**Explanations of the technologies used,** 
I used an api called OMDB for movies and tv-shows. 

While this was majority of the information for the 

page i did incorperate a modal to display the 

information in a more dramatic fashion.

**The approach taken**
Identifing the information supplied from the api i began to wireframe how i wanted the site to dispay the inital text box and submit button. A modal was to display all the information of the requested media with a bit of focus besides statically adding it to the page.

**Installation instructions:**
None required for this application.

**Unsolved problems**
Having gone through a few api before landing back on this one time ended up being a factor in adding in my random movie function like the google feeling lucky button. With the imdb ids used by the api i wasnt able to devise a solution to be able to generate these ids with any accuracy. Would love to add that when time permitted for it to be a "hey what movie should we watch" and it spit out a random title or series.
